The goal of rdcAVS is to streamline the process of creating SIA campaign folders in the DRC. The package is
designed to be portable and secure. Data for the geographies and permissions are stored locally and 
are uploaded by the user directly. Currently, the package comes with the campaign template, but future versions will allow 
users to upload their own modified campaign template file. The package is still under development, but a beta version is available.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rdcAVS from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("mcuadera/rdcAVS")
```

## Example

There is only one function in this package. To deploy the app locally, simply run the following code:

``` r
library(rdcAVS)

campagneApp()
```

## Demonstration

An example of the app deployed can be viewed [here]("https://mcuadera.shinyapps.io/rdcAVS/").
