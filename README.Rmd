# rdcAVS

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rdcAVS is to streamline the process of creating SIA campaign folders. The package is
designed to be portable and secure. Data for the geographies and permissions are stored locally and 
are uploaded by the user directly. Currently, the package comes with the template Excel file but 
in future versions will allow users to upload their own modified campaign template file.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rdcAVS from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("mcuadera/rdcAVS")
```

## Example

To run the app, simply run the following code:

``` r
library(rdcAVS)

## basic example code
campagneApp()
```
