# rdcAVS

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rdcAVS is to streamline the process of creating SIA campaign folders. The package is
designed to be portable, thanks to the use of `renv`. By default, the `.Renviron` file loads the library contained within the package. This ensures minimal set-up is required for building the app.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rdcAVS from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("mcuadera/rdcAVS")
```

## Example

To run the app, simply run the following code:

``` r
library(rdcAVS)

## basic example code
campagneApp()
```
